## new_puck — hockey analytics starter project

This repository is a small Python-based starter for a hockey analytics project. It implements the initial tasks described in the original project notes: drawing a rink, fetching the most recent Philadelphia Flyers game from the NHL API, parsing events (shots/goals), producing a shot-location plot, and serving a tiny demo website that displays the plot.

Goals and scope
- Provide a reusable rink plotting module so other visualizations (shot plots, heatmaps, movement traces) can be layered on top.
- Provide a lightweight NHL API client that can fetch a recent Flyers game for debugging.
- Parse a single game's live feed into a simple list of event objects.
- Produce a demo plot of shot locations from that game and save it to `static/shot_plot.png`.
- Serve a minimal Flask site that shows the generated plot.

Quickstart (macOS / bash)
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Generate the demo shot plot (this will call the NHL public API):

```bash
python demo_plot.py
```

4. Run the demo website and open http://127.0.0.1:5000:

```bash
python app.py
```

Project layout
- `requirements.txt` — minimal Python dependencies (Flask, requests, matplotlib)
- `rink.py` — code to draw a hockey rink using matplotlib
- `nhl_api.py` — small client to fetch the most recent Flyers game and its live feed
- `parse_events.py` — parse the game's events into a normalized structure
- `demo_plot.py` — script that fetches a game, parses shot/goal events, and creates a shot plot saved to `static/shot_plot.png`
- `app.py` — minimal Flask app that serves a page with the generated plot
- `templates/index.html` — simple template for the web UI

Initial tasks mapping (status: implemented)
1) Rink plotting code — Done (`rink.py`).
2) NHL API client (most recent Flyers game) — Done (`nhl_api.py`).
3) Game -> events parser — Done (`parse_events.py`).
4) Demo: shot location plot — Done (`demo_plot.py`).
5) Basic website — Done (`app.py`, `templates/index.html`).

Notes and next steps
- This is a starter implementation to get a working pipeline. Improvements to consider:
  - Add caching of API responses to avoid repeated network calls.
  - Add unit tests for parsing and plotting.
  - Add support for team selection and date ranges.
  - Add a small CLI and better logging.
