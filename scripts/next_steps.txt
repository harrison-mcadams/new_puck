# fix player website

# fix colorbar

# add all of the features: score_state, time_elapsed, time_elapsed_in_period

# add past event infrastructure, leading to rebounds, cycle, rush, and *more*

# remove empty net situations entirely?

# rink adjustment?

# team-wise and player-wise models, looking for ways in which a team/player feature would influence xg from a given event
